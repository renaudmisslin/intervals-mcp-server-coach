# Tool, Resource, and Prompt Reference

Complete inventory of everything the Intervals.icu MCP server exposes: up to 58 tools across 11 categories, 4 MCP Resources, and 7 MCP Prompts.

## Delete Safety Mode

Destructive tools are gated by the optional `INTERVALS_ICU_DELETE_MODE` env var. The gate sits **outside the model's reach** — tools that aren't registered cannot be invoked by any prompt or parameter.

| Mode | Registered tools | Events | Activities | Gear | Sport settings | Custom items |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `safe` (default) | 55 | tomorrow or later | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `full` | 58 | any date | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `none` | 52 | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

In `safe` mode, `icu_delete_event` and `icu_bulk_delete_events` return a uniform envelope showing what was deleted and what was skipped:

```json
{
  "deleted": [124],
  "deleted_count": 1,
  "skipped": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "reason": "past_event",
      "start_date_local": "2026-04-15",
      "hint": "Past events (today and earlier) require INTERVALS_ICU_DELETE_MODE=full."
    }
  ],
  "skipped_count": 1
}
```

Set the mode in your client config alongside the credentials:

```json
"env": {
  "INTERVALS_ICU_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
  "INTERVALS_ICU_ATHLETE_ID": "i123456",
  "INTERVALS_ICU_DELETE_MODE": "safe"
}
```

**Events vs. activities — two separate records:** An event is a calendar entry (planned workout, race, note). An activity is a recorded workout synced from a device or uploaded manually. Completing a workout links the activity to the event, but both records remain independent — deleting one leaves the other intact. Deleting an event removes the plan from your calendar; the recorded data survives. Deleting an activity permanently removes the training data; the event remains on the calendar (reverting to an unexecuted plan). This is why `icu_delete_activity` is `full`-only: it destroys recorded training data with no recovery path. Event deletion is available in `safe` mode (future events only) because removing an unexecuted plan is low-stakes.

**Why today is treated as past:** Safe mode only deletes events dated *strictly after today* in the server's local timezone. The one-day buffer absorbs server-vs-athlete TZ skew. If you run the server in Docker (defaults to UTC) and live in a different timezone, set the container's `TZ` env var to match your athlete profile (e.g., `TZ=Europe/Berlin`) so "today" lines up.

**Why sport settings and custom items are full-only:** Sport-settings deletion shifts retroactive chart math (current FTP/zones drive past activity calculations on Intervals.icu, so deleting them re-renders historical training load). Custom items can be data-bearing fields whose values are stored across activities. Neither is recoverable by re-creating the deleted record.
